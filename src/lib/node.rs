//! Node role/configuration types and the [`CSINode`] orchestrator.
//!
//! This module owns the user-facing description of a CSI node — its role
//! ([`NodeRole`], and for a collector its capture path [`CollectorMode`]), the
//! per-mode configs ([`EmitterConfig`], [`WifiSnifferConfig`],
//! [`WifiStationConfig`], [`WifiApConfig`]), and the TX/RX toggles — plus
//! [`CSINode`], whose `run` / `run_duration` wire up Wi-Fi, CSI, and the
//! role-specific tasks. It also holds the shared stop signal and the per-run
//! lifecycle helpers.
//!
//! There are exactly two roles. An **emitter** puts known RF energy into the
//! channel and never captures; a **collector** captures the channel's response
//! and delivers it. Everything else — station, softAP, promiscuous sniffer — is a
//! *way of collecting*, not a role of its own.
