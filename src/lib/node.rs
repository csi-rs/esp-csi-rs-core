//! Node topology/configuration types and the [`CSINode`] orchestrator.
//!
//! This module owns the user-facing description of a CSI node — its role
//! ([`Node`] / [`CentralOpMode`] / [`PeripheralOpMode`]), the per-mode configs
//! ([`EspNowConfig`], [`WifiSnifferConfig`], [`WifiStationConfig`]), the
//! collection and TX/RX toggles — and [`CSINode`], whose `run` / `run_duration`
//! wire up Wi-Fi, CSI, and the mode-specific tasks. It also holds the shared
//! stop signal and the per-run lifecycle helpers.
